## Programs

### abi-wrapper

Basic usage example outlined in a dummy wrapper program, which simply calls the main zeta program instructions. Also includes account layouts and outlines how to read all relevant on-chain data from the Zeta program.
This should give all the boilerplate needed to execute core program functionality both as the smart contract and off-chain client.
